On November 9, after meeting with thirteen individuals who shared the Des Jardins' desire and determination to make the vision a reality, Share Corporation was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share Corporation's original strategic plan was to service the end-user directly with competitively priced quality products, all while assuring the corporation and its sales force of a fair profit. This plan was implemented at a small, 10,000 square-foot warehouse in Brookfield, Wisconsin, where $100,000 worth of merchandise was shipped in it's first month of existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>​</span><img alt=\"Share-old.gif\" class=\"floatLeftImg\" height=\"145\" src=\"/sites/default/files/Share-old.gif\" style=\"float:left\" width=\"250\" /><span>​</span> Over the next decade, Share experienced tremendous growth in sales, size and diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After moving into a new 30,000 square-foot warehouse in 1980, Share purchased Athea Laboratories, Inc., a specialty-chemical manufacturer and product development company. It was not long after the purchase of Athea that Share became an industry leader in the niche market of chemical specialties. In June of 2013, Laure Des Jardins became President of the company and Share became a women-owned business. Patricia Des Jardins is still vitally involved with daily operations as Share's Chairperson of the Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of Athea's research and development expertise, Share quickly expanded its product line of over 400 special-chemical products. From herbicides to insecticides to industrial cleaners to aerosols—Share has a product to serve virtually every industry and business. In January of 2003, Share introduced Hercules Hardware into its product line. Added lines in Fall of 2013 were Partsmaster, Edge Eyewear, Pyramex, Westchester Protective Gear, ORS Nasco and Spill Tech. Share has become a \"one stop shop.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share's corporate headquarters is currently located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where today's employees continue to realize Paul and Patricia Des Jardins' initial vision to light and maintain the family tradition that they introduced throughout the entire company.</p>\r\n",

By eliminating these types of soils, BLAST ensures that compressors and pumps won’t labor under damaging stress. This keeps heating and cooling units operating at peak efficiency. Best of all, no water rinse or messy clean-up is required. The remaining residue that develops automatically washes away with the condensation that forms on fins and coils.

Once water makes contact with DR-OP granular drain opener, a chemical reaction is generated that causes the water to rapidly heat. This heating action, combined with DR-OP's other potent ingredients, begins to dislodge a variety of drain barriers including hair, soap, animal and vegetable fats, grease, organic waste and even paper. DR-OP granular drain opener is safe enough to use on sewer, drain and plumbing pipes on a regularly scheduled basis.

DYNASTY X-FLSUH is formulated with several advanced strains of bacteria that eat away at organic waste and clogs. DYNASTY X-FLUSH begins to establish thousands of bacteria colonies on pipe walls as it is applied on a regular schedule. These groups of bacteria immediately attack and digest grease, grime, cellulose, starches, proteins, carbohydrates and animal and vegetable fats as soon as waste enters drains. The bacteria in DYNASTY X-FLUSH naturally break down organic waste into harmless carbon dioxide and water. This natural process of decomposition not only clears out blockages, but also eliminates foul odors. An added blue dye indicates the presence of product in the pipes of automated pumping or dispensing systems. DYNASTY X-FLUSH is safe for use in X-ray, CAT scan and MRI drain systems. A maintenance program with DYNASTY X-FLUSH keeps drains and pipes free from organic waster build-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Features</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Formulated with a liquid suspension facultative bacteria cultures and a blue dye to make product visible in the pipes of automated systems.</li>\r\n\t<li>Developed for Share's BIO-DRAIN PUMP programmable automatic dispensing system.</li>\r\n\t<li>A designated Green Product means it is safe for the environment.</li>\r\n\t<li>Developed for use in photo processing drain lines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The active ingredient in SOY LIFT, soy methyl ester, eliminates organic waste build-up with the same or better solvency as other, more hazardous degreasers. However, SOY LIFT is 100% biodegradable, so it's not only effective but ecological as well. SOY LIFT has a higher flashpoint and lower VOC content than other solvents, making it less flammable, less hazardous and more environmentally friendly to use. Plus SOY LIFT won't evaporate as fast as other solvents, so it remains on the surface of waste water longer. SOY LIFT penetrates fats, grease and dirt to strip them away from surfaces while eliminating foul odors with a mild, green apple scent. When lift stations need greases and fats lifted and removed, use a degreaser made with natural ingredients only Mother Nature could produce. Use SOY LIFT from Share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Features</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Distilled from renewable plant and vegetable resources.</li>\r\n\t<li>Special pigment indicator provides easy visual verification of level in lift stations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ideal for sanitary and storm sewers, lift stations, and sewage treatment plants.</li>\r\n\t<li>Contains no petroleum distillates or chlorinated hydrocarbons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Its purpose is to prevent and/or correct hose/wire failure associated with industrial wear and tear. The advantage of using Share's RUB GUARD 6 over the other protection wraps is the neoprene. This neoprene based product is known to be chemically resistant in harsh industrial environments where it is common to have hoses/wires exposed to oil, gasoline, environmental conditions, alkalis and acids. The neoprene rubber also exhibits extreme resistance to flame, abrasion and flex cracking. Neoprene gets even better with its exceptional elastic qualities making the application of RUB GUARD 6 simple and easy. Once applied, the elasticity of the product allows the repaired hose/wire to remain flexible. Share's RUB GUARD 6 will prevent hose to hose abrasion, protect abrasion areas and repair abrasion cuts, and provide weather and moisture protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"featuresbox\">\r\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5>Features</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Simple and easy to apply.</li>\r\n\t<li>No special tools needed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Saves on equipment downtime.</li>\r\n\t<li>Will provide insulating and sealing protection to hose/wire.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n",

FREE FLOAT OWS is a concentrated cleaner and degreaser designed specifically for use with Oil/Water Separator (OWS) SYSTEMS. Unlike most detergents that emulsify fats, oils and grease (FOG) but allow them to pass through OWS systems into the sewer lines, FREE FLOAT OWS releases the emulsified FOG into a separate oil layer. This allows users to collect the free-flowing FOG with absorbent pads, booms or other oil collection methods, while solid dirt and debris remain in solution to be removed in the silt chamber or other filtration system. It only takes a few ounces of FREE FLOAT OWS per gallon of wash water to effectively clean and degrease equipment, vehicles and tools. Plus, if bioremediation is the chosen method for FOG disposal, FREE FLOAT OWS will not interfere with the bioremediation process. Don't continue to allow oil and pollutants in rinse water to seep into sewer lines, separate them safely and effectively with FREE FLOAT OWS from Share.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"featuresbox\">\r\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\r\n\r\n<h5>Features</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Highly concentrated formula was developed exclusively for use with OWS systems.</li>\r\n\t<li>Effectively and efficiently lifts away dirt, grease, oil and other contaminates from any water-washable surface.</li>\r\n\t<li>Allows emulsified fats, oils and grease to coalesce into a separate oil layer, while dirt and debris are filtered away separately.</li>\r\n\t<li>Will not interfere or inhibit the bioremediation process of fats, oils and grease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"proddesc\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
